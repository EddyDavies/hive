"""Reconcile live tabs and panes against the state index and refresh records.

This is the logic behind the `record` subcommand, which runs as both the
startup hook and the event hook for the events listed in herdr-plugin.toml.
One pass, under the state lock:

1. tab.list -> which tabs are alive right now, and their 0-based position
   among the tabs of their own workspace (ignoring the "number" field).
2. workspace.list -> label per workspace_id.
3. pane.list {} (no params = every workspace) -> the set of live pane ids
   and the set of live terminal ids. Both are needed, see below.
4. agent.list -> which panes are running an agent.
5. Tab deaths: any tab_id previously tracked in the index that is no longer
   live (or is the tab.closed event's forced tab_id) moves to the front of
   `closed` as a kind == "tab" entry. This also covers the case where
   closing the last pane of a tab destroys the tab without ever emitting
   tab.closed: the next reconciled event notices the tab_id missing from
   tab.list and retires it. Then every kind == "pane" entry whose tab is no
   longer live is pruned - its tab is gone, so it can never be restored,
   and leaving it in would park dead weight at the front of the stack.
6. Pane deaths: for each still-live tracked tab, any pane in its PREVIOUS
   record that has died becomes a kind == "pane" entry.

   A pane died iff its pane_id is absent from pane.list AND its recorded
   terminal_id is also absent. The two-part test is not belt and braces:
   moving a pane to another workspace changes its pane_id while the
   terminal_id follows the pane, so an id-only test would record every
   cross-workspace move as a bogus undo entry. Closing a pane for real
   removes both.
7. Refresh: for each live tab, layout.export it and upsert a fresh record.
   A failed or empty export leaves the existing record untouched - a
   record must never be replaced by a worse one. Each live pane is also
   asked what it is running (one pane.process_info, or nothing at all for
   a pane whose agent.list entry already answers it), so a restore can
   bring the process back and not just the layout. That question is only
   answerable while the pane lives, which is why it is asked every pass
   and not at death.
8. Trim and write.

Steps 5 and 6 both stamp the same now_ms, so the stack cannot order them by
time. The tie-break is insertion order: tab deaths are inserted first and
pane deaths second, each at position 0, which leaves pane deaths ahead of
tab deaths for a pass that saw both. That is deliberate and there is no
sort - the only way to see both in one pass is a tab dying while an
unrelated pane died, and the pane is the more surprising loss to offer
first.

The index keeps each tab's layout tree UNSTRIPPED, under the key "tree",
because a pane-death record is computed from it and needs pane ids to find
the dead pane's parent split. The safety property that mattered in version 1
is preserved where it matters: a dying tab's record stores the STRIPPED tree
under "root", so a stale pane id can never be read back by layout.apply as
"move this live pane".
