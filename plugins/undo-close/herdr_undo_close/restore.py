"""Restore one closed entry: a whole tab, or a single pane into a live tab.

`reopen_at` (used by both the `reopen` subcommand and the picker) reads an
entry from `closed`, restores it, and only removes it from the stack after
the restore succeeds:

    read under lock -> release -> restore (socket round trips) -> re-acquire
    to remove by identity -> release

The lock is never held across a socket round trip, and removal is keyed on
identity - (tab_id, closed_ms) for a tab, (pane_id, closed_ms) for a pane -
rather than "pop index 0 again", so a concurrent record pass that pushed a
new death in between cannot cause the wrong entry to be dropped.

Two restore paths, because Herdr gives us two very different tools:

* A closed TAB is rebuilt with layout.apply WITHOUT a tab_id, which creates a
  new tab, plus a best-effort tab.move. This path replays per-pane launch
  commands, because layout.apply's tree carries them, and it is also how a
  recorded process comes back: a `command` on a pane node is honoured, so the
  restore hangs one there.
* A closed PANE is rebuilt with pane.split + pane.rename + pane.swap on the
  tab that is still alive. It cannot use layout.apply: measured against Herdr
  0.7.5, layout.apply WITH a tab_id closes the target tab, returns a
  different tab_id, mints all-new pane ids and loses the surviving panes'
  scrollback. A pane_id inside a LayoutNode does not mean "reuse this live
  pane", so there is no non-destructive layout.apply for a surviving tab.
  pane.split has no `command` parameter either, so bringing a process back
  here means typing it into the new pane's shell with pane.send_text, once
  that shell is provably ready. The dead pane's original launch command is
  still not replayed, and the summary says so when nothing took its place.

What comes back is documented, not silently lossy: a workspace or position
fallback is reported, an approximate split position is reported, a dropped
launch command is reported, and every process is reported as relaunched,
deliberately skipped, or attempted and failed. Caveats that stopped being
true are dropped rather than inverted: an agent that WAS resumed is not
also announced as "not restarted".
